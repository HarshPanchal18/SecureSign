# Prompts used while building this app

## Let's focus on building your custom authenticator app. Here are the essential steps:

1. **Define Your Requirements**:
   - Decide on the features your authenticator app will offer. Will it generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), support push notifications, or have additional security layers?

2. **Choose a Technology Stack**:
   - Select the programming language and framework for your app. Common choices include Python, Java, Swift (for iOS), or Kotlin (for Android).

3. **Design the User Interface (UI)**:
   - Sketch out the UI for your app. Consider elements like login screens, QR code scanning, and settings.

4. **Implement TOTP Generation**:
   - Research how TOTP algorithms work (e.g., HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256).
   - Write code to generate TOTPs based on the shared secret and current time.

5. **QR Code Scanning**:
   - Implement QR code scanning functionality to link the app with user accounts.
   - Use a library like `ZXing` for QR code decoding.

6. **Secure Storage**:
   - Store shared secrets securely. Avoid hardcoding them in your app.
   - Use secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on iOS or Keystore on Android).

7. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Test your app thoroughly. Verify TOTP generation, QR code scanning, and UI interactions.
   - Debug any issues you encounter.

8. **Deployment and Distribution**:
   - Deploy your app to a test device or emulator.
   - Consider distributing it via app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store) or other channels.

9. **User Experience (UX)**:
   - Ensure a smooth user experience. Make the app intuitive and user-friendly.

10. **Security Audits**:
    - Conduct security audits to identify vulnerabilities.
    - Address any security flaws promptly.

Remember to document your code, follow best practices, and seek feedback from peers. Good luck with your authenticator app development! üöÄüîê

## Kotlin Library
Certainly! If you‚Äôre building a custom authenticator app in Kotlin, you can use existing libraries to handle Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) generation. Here are a couple of Kotlin libraries you can explore:

`totp-kt:`
* totp-kt is a native Kotlin library for TOTP and HMAC-based HOTP one-time passwords.
It supports validation and generation of 2-factor authentication codes, recovery codes, and secure secrets.
You can find installation instructions and usage details in the documentation12.

`kotlin-onetimepassword:`
* kotlin-onetimepassword is another Kotlin library for generating one-time password codes.
It covers both TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) and HOTP (HMAC-Based One-Time Password) algorithms based on RFC 4226 and RFC 62383.
